# I started by analyzing the climate data in Hawaii. I charted the precipitation data of the final 12 months inlcuded in the dataset and then calculated the minimum, average, and maximum temperature of the most active station in the area for those 12 months. 

# I then created a Flask API based on those query results. The API has mulitple routes that shows all the precipitaiton data in the dataset, all of the stations in the dataset, the temperatue of the most active station, and the minimum/average/maximum temperature for a given date range for all stations.
